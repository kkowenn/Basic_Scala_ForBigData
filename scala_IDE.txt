an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
like IntelliJ IDEA or another code editor configured for Scala development.
The menu is asking:

1. **Empty file**: Creates a new file with no predefined content.
You can write any kind of code or data into this file.

2. **Class**: Creates a new Scala class.
A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances),
containing fields and methods to define the behavior and state of the objects.

3. **Case Class**: Creates a new Scala case class.
Case classes are a special type of class in Scala that are immutable by default
and provide pattern matching capabilities. They are often used to model immutable data.

4. **Object**: Creates a new Scala object.
An object is a singleton instance, meaning there is only one instance of it in the JVM.
Objects are used for defining utility methods, constants,
or to act as an entry point for the program (similar to static methods in Java).

5. **Trait**: Creates a new Scala trait.
Traits are like interfaces in Java but can also contain concrete methods and fields.
They are used to define reusable behaviors that can be mixed into classes.

6. **Package Object**: Creates a new package object.
Package objects are used to define methods, fields,
or type aliases that can be shared across multiple classes and traits in a package.

7. **Worksheet**: Creates a new Scala worksheet.
Worksheets are special files in Scala IDEs where you can write
and execute Scala code interactively. They are great for quick experimentation and
learning.

8. **Scala Script (Ammonite or Scala CLI)**: Creates a new Scala script file,
which can be executed using Ammonite or Scala CLI.
Ammonite is a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for Scala,
and Scala CLI is a command-line tool to compile and run Scala code.
This option is used for scripting purposes,
allowing for quick execution of Scala code without the need for a full project setup.

9. **Enum**: Creates a new enumeration in Scala. Enums are used to define a set of named values, which can be used as constants. This is useful for defining a collection of related constants, like days of the week or directions.
